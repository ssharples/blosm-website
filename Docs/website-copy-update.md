FAQ Section
Section Title: Common Questions
How can you deliver so quickly?
We use advanced AI to automate the time-consuming parts of web design—content extraction, image optimization, and initial setup. This lets us focus human expertise on perfecting your specific needs.
What if I need changes after launch?
Minor text updates are free for 30 days. For ongoing changes, our Maintained plan (£79/month) includes monthly updates and priority support.
Do I own my website?
Absolutely. Once paid, the website is yours. You can host it elsewhere if you prefer, though our hosting includes maintenance and support.
What about my existing domain?
We'll connect your existing domain at no extra charge, or help you register a new one if needed.
Is this just a template?
Yes and no. We start with premium templates but customize them extensively with your branding, content, and specific requirements. The result is unique to your business.
What if I don't like the demo?
No obligation. If you don't love the demo, you pay nothing. We only proceed when you're completely satisfied with the direction.

Key Messaging Changes
From: "We automate the entire process" (vague, process-focused)
To: "Your New Website. Live in 7 Days. Just £599" (specific, benefit-focused)
From: "Fraction of time and cost" (comparative, uncertain)
To: "£599 setup, 7-day delivery guaranteed" (concrete, confident)
From: "Book a free consultation" (traditional, time-consuming)
To: "Get Your Free Demo Website" (innovative, value-first)
Copy Guidelines for Your Brand Voice

Be specific with numbers - "7 days" not "quickly"
Lead with benefits - "Live in 7 days" not "AI-powered process"
Address objections directly - Don't hide that it's template-based
Use social proof early - Include client count/rating in hero section
Make guarantees bold - Your speed is your differentiator

Additional Pages to Create

Process - Detailed timeline of the 7 days
Simple Agreement - Your one-page terms
Refund Policy - Clear, simple terms

This positioning moves you from competing on "automation" (which sounds cheap) to competing on "speed and value" (which sounds smart). The focus on modernizing outdated sites also perfectly targets your ICP—businesses that already have websites but know they need updating.
